# Basic Calculator
## Description
This is an advanced calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it includes advanced features such as square root calculation, percentage calculation, and memory operations (M+, M-, MR, MC). It also handles errors like division by zero and follows the BODMAS order of operations.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Square Root Calculation (√)**: Calculate the square root of the current number.
- **Percentage Calculation (%)**: Calculate the percentage of the current number.
- **Memory Operations**:
  - **M+**: Adds the current input to memory.
  - **M-**: Subtracts the current input from memory.
  - **MR**: Recalls the value stored in memory.
  - **MC**: Clears the memory.
- **Clear Display (C)**: Clears the current input.
- **Error Handling**: Division by zero and invalid operations are handled gracefully.

## How to Use
1. **Input Numbers and Operators**:
   - Click the number buttons (0-9) and operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to input numbers and perform calculations.
2. **Perform Operations**:
   - Press "=" to get the result after entering your calculation.
   - Press "C" to clear the display.
3. **Square Root (√)**:
   - Press the "√" button to calculate the square root of the current number.
4. **Percentage (%)**:
   - Press the "%" button to calculate the percentage of the current number.
5. **Memory Functions**:
   - **M+**: Adds the current number to memory.
   - **M-**: Subtracts the current number from memory.
   - **MR**: Recalls the value stored in memory and displays it.
   - **MC**: Clears the memory.
6. **Error Handling**:
   - If division by zero is attempted, an error message will appear, and the display will be cleared.
